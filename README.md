<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm AbdelMonem ELkalalf</h1>
<h3 align="center">Software Engineer</h3>

I'm a backend engineer with a strong focus on PHP and Laravel. Iâ€™ve also worked with React and Vue when needed. While I prefer backend, I'm open to working across the full stack. I enjoy learning new technologies and love contributing to open-source projects.
